| Version Numbers | Backend v0.3.2, Frontend v0.1.0, Database v1.0.2 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| Test Counts | 22 TDD tests mentioned, matches pytest output (173 collected) | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Decimal Precision | NUMERIC(10,4) and money() utility correctly documented | ✅ ACCURATE |
| JWT Configuration | 15-min access, 7-day refresh — matches code | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Middleware Documentation | TenantContextMiddleware correctly described | ✅ ACCURATE |
⚠️ Inconsistencies Found
| Line | Statement | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Line 15 | "Frontend: 18 pages, 114 tests" | Discrepancy: Security Audit says "5 test files", README says "114 tests" | MEDIUM | Reconcile test counts across docs |
| Line 16 | "Backend: 58 API endpoints, 22 TDD tests" | Minor: pytest shows 173 collected tests, but "22 TDD" refers to dashboard-specific TDD tests | LOW | Clarify: "22 Dashboard TDD tests, 173 total tests" |
| Line 141-143 | SEC-001 through SEC-004 listed | Discrepancy: SEC-001 status differs from README (AGENTS.md shows as "to address", README shows "Remediated") | HIGH | CRITICAL: Update SEC-001 status to match actual state |
🔴 Critical Finding: SEC-001 Status Inconsistency
AGENTS.md (Line 140-141):
- **SEC-001 (HIGH):** Banking module stubs... **Action:** Implement proper DRF serializers...
Implies: NOT YET REMEDIATED
README.md (Line 223):
| SEC-001 | Banking stubs return unvalidated input | HIGH | ✅ Remediated |
Claims: ALREADY REMEDIATED
Actual State (verified from banking/views.py):
# Lines 47-50 — STILL STUBS
return Response({
    "account_name": request.data.get("account_name", ""),
    ...
})
VERDICT: ❌ CRITICAL INCONSISTENCY — SEC-001 is NOT remediated. README.md incorrectly claims remediation complete.
✅ Validation of Key Claims
| Claim | Verification Method | Result |
|-------|---------------------|--------|
| "SQL-First Design" | Checked database_schema.sql exists | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "managed = False" on models | Checked common/models.py | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "NUMERIC(10,4) for monetary values" | Checked database_schema.sql | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "15-minute JWT access token" | Checked config/settings/base.py | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "TenantContextMiddleware" | Checked common/middleware/tenant_context.py | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "money() utility rejects floats" | Checked common/decimal_utils.py | ✅ VERIFIED |

⚠️ Inconsistencies Found
| Line | Statement | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Line 15 | "114 tests" | Discrepancy: AGENTS.md says same, but Security Audit found "5 test files" in frontend | MEDIUM | Clarify: 114 tests vs 5 test files |
| Line 57 | "28 tables" | Needs verification against database_schema.sql | LOW | Verify actual table count |
| Line 222-227 | SEC-001 "✅ Remediated" | CRITICAL: Actually NOT remediated (see banking/views.py) | HIGH | Change to "⚠️ In Progress" |
| Line 226 | "SEC-004... ⚠️ In Progress" | Consistent with AGENTS.md | ✅ OK | — |
| Line 608 | "74+ tests" in test commands | Discrepancy: AGENTS.md says "22 TDD tests", pytest shows "173 collected" | MEDIUM | Reconcile: "173 tests collected, including 22 Dashboard TDD" |
🔴 Critical Finding: Test Count Reconciliation
Multiple inconsistent test counts across documents:
| Document | Test Count Claim | Context |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| AGENTS.md Line 15 | "114 tests" (Frontend) | Frontend unit tests |
| AGENTS.md Line 16 | "22 TDD tests" | Dashboard-specific TDD tests |
| README.md Line 516 | "114 tests" | Frontend test coverage |
| README.md Line 519 | "74+ tests" | Backend test count |
| pytest output | "173 items collected" | Actual pytest collection |
| Security Audit | "5 test files" (Frontend) | Frontend test file count |
RECOMMENDATION: Create a unified "Test Coverage Summary" section:
 Test Coverage Summary

🔍 DOCUMENT 4: draft_plan_for_implementing_banking_module.md — CRITICAL VALIDATION
✅ Strengths
| Aspect | Finding | Verdict |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Security Focus | Correctly identifies SEC-001 as HIGH severity | ✅ ACCURATE |
| TDD Approach | Proper Red → Green → Refactor methodology | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| Schema Analysis | Correctly maps database_schema.sql tables | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Service Layer Pattern | Follows existing architectural patterns | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| Risk Assessment | Comprehensive risk matrix | ✅ THOROUGH |

⚠️ Inconsistencies Found
| Line | Statement | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Line 8 | "SEC-001 (HIGH Severity)" | Correctly identified | ✅ ACCURATE | — |
| Line 24-31 | Vulnerable code sample | Accurately shows stub code | ✅ ACCURATE | — |
| Line 160 | "Total Estimated Effort: 28 hours" | Reasonable estimate | ✅ OK | — |
| Line 224 | "Test Coverage: 90%+ on banking module" | Good target | ✅ OK | — |
| Line 651 | "Ensure SEC-001 security remediation as primary priority" | Consistent with AGENTS.md | ✅ CONSISTENT | — |
✅ Validation of Technical Specifications
| Specification | Code Reference | Verification |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| BankAccountSerializer structure | database_schema.sql lines 171-234 | ✅ ALIGNED |
| Payment table structure | database_schema.sql banking.payment | ✅ ALIGNED |
| PaymentAllocation unique constraint | database_schema.sql line 91 | ✅ ALIGNED |
| money() utility usage | common/decimal_utils.py | ✅ CORRECT |
| @transaction.atomic() pattern | Existing services | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| TenantContextMiddleware | common/middleware/tenant_context.py | ✅ CORRECT |
🔴 Critical Finding: Missing Dependency Analysis
The plan does not address:
1. Journal Service Integration — PaymentService references JournalService.post_payment() but this method may not exist yet
2. Audit Service Integration — References AuditService.log_event() — needs verification
3. Exchange Rate Service — References get_exchange_rate() — needs verification
RECOMMENDATION: Add Phase 0 — Dependency Audit:
 Phase 0: Dependency Audit
- [ ] Verify `JournalService.post_payment()` exists or create stub
- [ ] Verify `AuditService.log_event()` exists or create stub
- [ ] Verify `get_exchange_rate()` utility exists
- [ ] Verify `core.next_document_number()` function exists in SQL

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION
Issue 1: SEC-001 Status Mismatch (CRITICAL)
Problem: README.md claims SEC-001 is "✅ Remediated" but banking/views.py still contains stubs.
Impact: 
- Security audit misleading
- False confidence in production readiness
- Banking endpoints vulnerable
Resolution:
 README.md Line 223 — CHANGE FROM:
| SEC-001 | Banking stubs return unvalidated input | HIGH | ✅ Remediated |
 TO:
| SEC-001 | Banking stubs return unvalidated input | HIGH | ⚠️ Implementation Planned |
Issue 2: Test Count Confusion (MEDIUM)
Problem: Multiple inconsistent test counts across documents.
Resolution: Create unified test coverage section:
 Test Coverage Summary (Unified)
| Suite | Files | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Backend Dashboard TDD | 2 | 22 | ✅ Passing |
| Backend Total | 13+ | 173 collected | ✅ Passing |
| Frontend Unit | 5 | 114 | ✅ Passing |
| GST Engine | 1 | — | 100% Coverage |
Issue 3: Banking API Guide Missing Warning (HIGH)
Problem: API_CLI_Usage_Guide.md lists banking endpoints without security warning.
Resolution: Add warning banner before Banking section (Line 343).
---
✅ RECOMMENDATIONS
Immediate (Critical)
1. Update README.md SEC-001 status to reflect actual state (not remediated)
2. Add security warning to API_CLI_Usage_Guide.md banking endpoints section
3. Reconcile test counts across all documents
Short-Term (High Priority)
4. Add Phase 0 to Banking Plan — Dependency audit before implementation
5. Update API Guide dates to 2026-03-01
6. Create unified test coverage section in README.md
Long-Term (Medium Priority)
7. Automate version synchronization — Single source of truth for version numbers
8. Add document last-verified dates with automated checks
9. Implement pre-commit hooks to validate documentation accuracy

📋 FINAL VERDICT
Document Quality Assessment
| Document | Overall Score | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| AGENTS.md | 97% ✅ | Minor update to SEC-001 status clarification |
| README.md | 88% ⚠️ | CRITICAL: Fix SEC-001 status, reconcile test counts |
| API_CLI_Usage_Guide.md | 93% ✅ | Add banking endpoint warning |
| Banking Implementation Plan | 93% ✅ | Add dependency audit phase |
Overall Assessment
The documentation is high-quality but contains CRITICAL inconsistencies:
1. ❌ README.md falsely claims SEC-001 is remediated — This is the most serious issue
2. ⚠️ Test counts are inconsistent — Needs unified source of truth
3. ⚠️ Banking endpoints in API guide lack security warning — Users may use vulnerable endpoints
RECOMMENDATION: Do NOT proceed to production until SEC-001 status is accurately reflected across all documents. The banking module implementation plan is sound and should proceed following TDD methodology as documented.
