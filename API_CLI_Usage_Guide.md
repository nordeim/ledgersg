## 🎉 Recent Milestone: SMB Workflow Hardening ✅ COMPLETE (2026-03-10)

### Summary

Successfully completed full E2E validation for **Lakshmi's Kitchen** (12-month Corporate Cycle) and **ABC Trading** (Sole Prop Smoke Test). This involved hardening the `JournalService` posting engine and ensuring models match the `database_schema.sql` exactly.

### Key Knowledge & Fixes (Workflow 1 & 2)

| Category | Finding / Issue | Resolution / Knowledge |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Ghost Columns** | Model inheritance adding `created_at` to tables without them. | Switched `Peppol` models to inherit from `models.Model` to match SQL exactly. |
| **Logic Filter** | `is_voided` filter in `JournalService` caused 500 errors. | Removed invalid filter; posting engine now handles lines via the document's approved state. |
| **Side Effects** | Payments alone don't show revenue. | **MANDATORY**: You MUST call `/approve/` on an invoice to trigger the Revenue/AR journal entries. |
| **Response Wrapper** | Consistent list wrapper used. | Always use `jq '.data'` for Accounts, Tax Codes, and Contacts. |

## Troubleshooting (Updated)

### "ProgrammingError: column organisation_peppol_settings.created_at does not exist"
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (2026-03-10)
**Cause**: The model was incorrectly inheriting from a base class that adds timestamp fields not present in the SQL schema.
**Solution**: Ensure models match `database_schema.sql` exactly.

### "FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'is_voided' into field"
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (2026-03-10)
**Cause**: Service layer code was trying to filter by a field that doesn't exist in the database table.
**Solution**: Refined `JournalService` to query lines directly via the parent document.

## CLI Examples

### 1. Approve an Invoice (Mandatory for GL)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/{orgId}/invoicing/documents/{id}/approve/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Verify Ledger Posting
```bash
# Check if journal entries were created
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/{orgId}/journal-entries/entries/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq '.data'
```
