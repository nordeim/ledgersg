Awesome meticulous job so far. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously plan and create the complete backend codebase completion plan that matches your updated database schema design. Break down your API backend execution plan using the Django framework into logical phases that can be executed independently, and for each phase, list the files to create/update, along with a description of the features and interfaces. Also, include in your backend codebase completion execution plan an integrated checklist for each phase. Next, review and validate your backend execution plan.

Awesome job on your meticulous research, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work on your rigorous and meticulous approach going forward. Now, please meticulously plan and then create a remediation plan to close the issues identified in @Comprehensive_Validation_Report.md after validating the issues against the actual codebase again to double-check and confirm. In your remediation plan, break it down into logical phases which can be executed independently, and for each phase list out the files to create or update, add describe the changes and add an integrated checklist for each file that needs to be created or updated. Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the code changes. Review and validate your remediation plan before proceeding to execute it phase by phase sequentially.
